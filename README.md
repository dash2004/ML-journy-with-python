# ML-journy-with-python
# Hi — I'm Dhanush 👋  
Student • ML Engineering & Data Engineering enthusiast

- 🔭 Currently learning production ML and scalable data pipelines
- 🎓 Computer Science student (or studying — replace with your program/university)
- 🧰 Primary interests: feature engineering, model deployment, ETL, data reliability
- 🌱 Currently exploring: MLflow, Airflow, Kafka, and model monitoring

## About me
I enjoy turning messy data into reliable features and shipping models that run in production. I focus on reproducible experiments, clear data contracts, and automating pipelines so teams can trust ML-driven features.

## Skills
- Languages: Python, SQL, (TypeScript / Go — add if you use them)
- ML & libraries: scikit-learn, PyTorch, TensorFlow, XGBoost
- Data engineering: Airflow, dbt (or mention if learning), Spark (if applicable), Kafka
- Infra & tooling: Docker, MLflow, GitHub Actions, cloud (GCP / AWS / Azure — add your cloud)
- DBs / storage: PostgreSQL, BigQuery, S3
- Experiment & monitoring: MLflow, Prometheus / Grafana (or other)

## Featured projects
- **ml-feature-store** — ETL pipelines + offline/online feature sync (Airflow → Redis). [Replace with your repo name & short link]
- **demand-forecast** — Time-series forecasting pipeline with model tracking & scheduled retraining. [Replace with your repo name & short link]
- **notebooks-eda** — Clean, documented notebooks demonstrating EDA, baselines, and model comparisons. [Replace with your repo name & short link]

(Replace the placeholders above with your project names, 1–2 line descriptions, and links. Aim to pin 3–6 repos on your profile that are well-documented.)

## How I work
- Start with simple baselines and iterate using clear evaluation metrics
- Reproducible experiments: seed, deterministic pipelines, and tracked runs (MLflow)
- CI for data/code: tests for data quality and model contracts, small PRs, and clear docs
- Prefer clear READMEs and runnable examples (Docker, scripts, or colab/notebook links)

## Education & learning
- (AMET University  — FINAL YEAR) — BE CSE(AIML), expected graduation, relevant courses
- Currently learning: model deployment, streaming ETL, and production monitoring

## What I'm looking for
- Internships, mentorship, and open-source collaboration in ML engineering or data engineering
- Projects where I can practice productionizing models and building reliable pipelines
